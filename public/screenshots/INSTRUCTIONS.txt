To add your screenshots:

1. Take screenshots of your application pages
2. Save them with these exact names in this directory:
   - dashboard.png
   - transactions.png
   - transaction-details.png
   - create-transaction.png
   - payment.png
   - join-transaction.png

OR

Use the screenshots you showed me earlier - save them as PNG files with the names above.

For now, the component will show fallback placeholders until you add the images.
